# learnNerf
We will train a nerf from scratch and see the latest advancements in NerF by implementing stuff in python.

## Build Nerf from Scratch

### Chapter 1
Can we overfit an image? Given the pixel location can we predict the pixel color of that image??


### Chapter 2
Can we improve this? Maybe if we can transform the space into fourier space?


Why this works much better??


### Chapter 3
Using features in Fourier space is also known as position encoding in Nerfs, transformer etc. 
How will you explain nerf ?? => Lets say for a scence you have multiple viewpoints and corresponding multiple images. I want to learn a neural network such that given any viewpoint I can predict the scence.
